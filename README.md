## Apna Transaction
### Stay on top of your budget.

## Problem Statement: 

Daily life poses many challenges to managing expenditures, making it difficult to plan future transactions based on previous transactions. 
By introducing a simple yet powerful mobile application, our application embeds the seed of technology to make our lives easier.
College students are most affected by this problem since they do not have prior experience managing their budgets and end up spending a great deal of money and facing harsh consequences.

## Proposed Solution

A comprehensive application to manage the budget in daily life by calculating the details of expenditures.
As well as planning future transactions, this application also keeps track of past transactions.
* Students are provided with the option to keep a record of their expenditures every week..
*  The amount of money spent on each day during the past seven days is displayed to the user.
* The user can compare the daily expenditure as the data is displayed graphically.

## Functionality & Concepts used:

Apna Transaction is a custom application developed specifically on the basis of the Android Jetpack libraries.
* Lazy column
* Animation
* Material Theming: Light and dark; shape modification; typography.
* Lambda expressions:- high-order functions
* Date Picker
* Data Class

## Future Scope
Having the ability to link this application with other sources and applications will give this application a vast horizon in the future. 
* In addition, we will create a graphic representation of the transaction.
* Along with this regular balance, checks will provide an easy way to budget and save.
* Users can set financial goals and set them to be completed within a specified time frame.
* Students, freelancers, and part-time workers would also be able to use the application if it was added to credit and debit transactions.
* Our application will also be connected to Firebase in the future for online data storage and enhanced transparency.
* In addition, we want to extend the application with a unique feature that allows groups to split transactions between members.
