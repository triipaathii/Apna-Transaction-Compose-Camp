## Apna Transaction
### Stay on top of your budget.

## Problem Statement: 

Daily life poses many challenges to managing expenditures, making it difficult to plan future transactions based on previous transactions. 
By introducing a simple yet powerful mobile application, our application embeds the seed of technology to make our lives easier.
College students are most affected by this problem since they do not have prior experience managing their budgets and end up spending a great deal of money and facing harsh consequences.

## Proposed Solution

A comprehensive application to manage the budget in daily life by calculating the details of expenditures.
As well as planning future transactions, this application also keeps track of past transactions.
* Students are provided with the option to keep a record of their expenditures every week..
*  The amount of money spent on each day during the past seven days is displayed to the user.
* The user can compare the daily expenditure as the data is displayed graphically.
